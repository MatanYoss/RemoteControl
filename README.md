# RemoteControl
A cool remote control program that I have created in python and WPF :)

# What it inclues?

A multi - threading program, buillt in WPF[the GUI SIDE] that interacts with python, and gives the abillity to control all the clients that have connected to it thogether, at the same time.
Things that the control user can do on each client(one option each time):
A. An option to open a rev shell, which includes:
  1. remote code execution(Including execution of a binary/any file on the victims computer).		
  2. upload files form the control user compuer to the victims computer, or download files.
  3. An option to encrypt/decrypt files using the AES algoritem(With a libary that I have buillt).		
  4. Navigate in the victim's computer using the cd command
			
B. An option to see the victims screen Live

C. A keylogger - that gives the abillety to see what the victims type live, for an ammount of time that the user decides. 

IMPORTANT - A full description about the project(and about its windows) can be found in the "Case.pdf" file. I very recommand you to take a look at it :)
